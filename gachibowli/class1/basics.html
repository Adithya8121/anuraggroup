			<a href="#">Honda</a> established a collective term, Honda Robotics, to represent the company’s robotics technologies and application products created through its research, design, and development of humanoid robot represented by ASIMO.
		</p>
		<p>
		Honda Motor Co., Ltd., and its subsidiaries, engages in the development, manufacture, and distribution of motorcycles, automobiles, and power products primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. Its motorcycle line consists of business and commuter models, as well as sports models, including trial and moto-cross racing; all—terrain vehicles; personal watercrafts; and multi utility vehicles.
		</p>
		<p>
		The company also produces various automobile products, including passenger cars, minivans, multi-wagons, sport utility vehicles, and mini cars; and power products comprising tillers, portable generators, general-purpose engines, grass cutters, outboard marine engines, water pumps, snow throwers, power carriers, power sprayers, lawn mowers and lawn tractors, home-use cogeneration units, and thin film solar cells for home, public, and industrial uses.
		</p>
		<p>

		In addition, it sells spare parts and provides after sales services are through retail dealers, as well as offers retail lending and leasing to customers, and wholesale financing to dealers. The company was founded in 1946 and is based in Tokyo, Japan.

		Robotics is one of Honda’s areas of research. In 1986, Honda engineers set out to create a robot that could walk. Two decades later, ASIMO is a full humanoid robot, able not only to walk but also to run, climb steps and even carry a tray or push a cart. Honda has leveraged some of this learning into the creation of working prototypes for two revolutionary walking assist devices.
