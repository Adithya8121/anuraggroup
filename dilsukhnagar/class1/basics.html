		<a href="#">Allu Arjun’s </a>Naa Peru Surya has been in the making for quite some time now. The film marks the debut of writer Vakkantam Vamsi as the director of this patriotic drama. After a huge round of promotions, this film has hit the screens today. Let’s see how it is.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Story:
		</h3>
		<p>
		Surya(Allu Arjun) is a passionate army officer who gets suspended due to his short-tempered attitude. He is given an ultimatum that if he needs his job back, he has to get a certificate from India’s biggest psychologist played by Arjun. But the twist here is that the psychologist is none other than Surya’s own dad whom he had left years back because of personal issues. Rest of the story is as to how an aggressive Surya confronts his father, manages his anger issues and the corrupt society which is filled up with a lot of bad people.
		</p>

		 
		<h3>Plus Points:</h3>
		<p>
		Right from the first frame, it is Allu Arjun and his stunning act that steals the show. Bunny’s aggressive actions and impressive screen presence brings a lot of depth to the proceedings. Bunny is at ease with his performance and nicely gets into the character of a man with serious anger management issues. As usual, he dances well and plays it to the galleries with his fights.
		</p>
		<p>
		Senior hero, Arjun does his role to the best of his qualities. Vennela Kishore evokes few laughs here and there in the latter half. Yesteryear heroine, Nadhiya impresses with her acting in her limited role.
		</p>
		<p>
		The interval bang is pretty decent and the way all the patriotic scenes are executed look good. The first fifteen minutes of the film featuring the army backdrop is quite gripping and have been executed well.</p>

		<h3>Minus Points:</h3>
		<p>
		After the gripping first fifteen minutes, things sidetrack a bit as the story wanders here and there. Things get set and the actual story kick starts only during the half point. All the episodes between Arjun and Bunny do not elevate enough emotions and look forced.
